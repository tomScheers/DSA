# DSA
The goal of this project is to define header files with data structures and appropriate algorithms to use them in other projects.

## Data Structures
Here's a list of the current data structures I'm planning on implementing:
[  ] Linked list
[  ] Dynamic array (vector)
[  ] Tree
[  ] Queue
[  ] Hashmap
[  ] Stack

## Project Structure
Each data structure will be defined in it's own header file, that way I can include only the necessary data structures needed for the project.
Each data structure will also have algorithms defined next to them, like sorting algorithms for the vector or a search function for the dynamic array.
